cabal install xmonad
cabal install --lib xmonad xmonad-contrib # make sure you also install xmonad as a lib so it compiles, not actually sure how to install the executable AND the lib
#optionally you can install xmobar(and theoretically taffybar) using:
cabal install -f with_xft -f with_xpm xmobar # because they default to false!  See other options in .cabal/packages/xmobar/...tar.gz

Update: this no longer works for xmonad for me, and I don't have the
smarts or patience to understand what cabal-install is doing.
Following the instructions to just clone xmonad + xmonad-contrib and
use stack worked just fine.
